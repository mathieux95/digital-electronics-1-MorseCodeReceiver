## Project objectives

The main objective of the project within the subject Digital Electronics 1 (Summer Semester 2022) was to create a Morse code Receiver. 
For completetion of the project we used these components: 
* NEXYS A7 50T board to conotrol all of the other parts
* 7-segment displays
*

The singal enters the processing unit via _____ connector, which receives the data input and uses comparable logic created mainly by IF / ELSEIF statements. The length of each symbol is 19bits, which after translation show up on the 7-segment displays. Each letter of the alphabet will be translated separately with final output lighting up on the a-g segments.  
Source code, testbenches and simulations are all developed in Vivado.

## Hardware description
### Nexys A7-50T
The Nexys A7 board is a complete, ready-to-use digital circuit development platform based on the latest Artix-7TM
Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) from Xilinx®. With its large, high-capacity FPGA, generous external
memories, and collection of USB, Ethernet, and other ports, the Nexys A7 can host designs ranging from
introductory combinational circuits to powerful embedded processors. Several built-in peripherals, including an
accelerometer, temperature sensor, MEMs digital microphone, a speaker amplifier, and several I/O devices allow
the Nexys A7 to be used for a wide range of designs without needing any other components.
